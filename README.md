Hi, Iâ€™m @Mo_

Interested in all things AoIP: Audio, networking, Linux kernel, ...

If you have some spare time, reading Don Norman's "The design of everyday things" would be a splendid and very insightful use of it. At least it was for me. 
You'll never look at doors the same way again, but it also helps tremendously when designing things. Ask Jeff Atwood.
